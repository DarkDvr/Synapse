# Known issues

Bugs found while doing something else. Each one says where it is, how it shows, and
what it would take. They are not fixed on the way past: a bug fixed inside an
unrelated change has two causes and one commit.

Newest first. When one is fixed, delete it here and say so in the commit.

## The screen badge may stay on screen after the desk is released — 7 Nov

Seen once, while checking the page after a refactor move: the desk badge read "Screen
in use — A worker may use your mouse and keyboard. Take Back" on a page that had just
loaded, while `/api/desk` answered `{"desk":null}` a few minutes later. No run had
started or finished in between, so either the badge was drawn from a state that was
already stale, or something set it that does not clear it.

Not reproduced: the page has been loaded a dozen times since and the badge was hidden
each time. So this is a "watch for it" entry, not a diagnosis.

Where: `web/desk.js` (`renderDesk`), whatever sets `state.desk` (boot's `/api/desk`
read and the `desk.*` events), and `src/desk.js` on the server.
Fix: when it happens again, read `/api/desk` at the same moment and compare. If the
server says null the page is the bug (a missing clear); if the server says held, the
server is (a lease that was never released).
